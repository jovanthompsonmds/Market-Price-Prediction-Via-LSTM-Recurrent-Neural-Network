# Market Price Prediction Via LSTM Recurrent Neural Network

## Overview  
This project implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNN) to predict Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock closing prices based on historical market data from 1980-2021. The model captures temporal dependencies in stock prices, allowing for more accurate financial forecasting. By leveraging deep learning, this project provides a robust approach to time-series analysis, achieving a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.68. The results offer valuable predictive insights for investors and analysts by visualizing model accuracy over real stock trends.

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing and sequencing data for training and testing. Handles missing values, scales data, and sequences it for time-series modeling.  
- **LSTM Architecture**: Implements two LSTM layers with dense layers for optimized forecasting. 
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses RMSE, MAE, and MSE to assess prediction accuracy. 
- **Prediction Visualization**: Compares predicted vs. actual stock prices for detailed trend analysis.
- **Forecasting Analysis**: Provides insights into 2021 and 2022 stock movement, helping evaluate model reliability.
